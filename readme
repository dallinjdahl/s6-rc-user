dallinjdahl/s6-rc-user

This repo is my personal setup for running a login session using s6-rc[1].
Note that in order to have X run properly, you need to have previously
run the following command[2]:

setcap cap_sys_tty_config=+ep /usr/lib/Xorg

The current setup allows you to customize services run on startup by
customizing the entries in the graphic bundle.  The desktop can be
brought up completely with the ops/begin script.

This particular setup was inspired by [2].
